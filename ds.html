I used to think that I’m not good enough because of my appearance and my way of thinking. Perfectness is not possible for normal humans but trying to do the right things is a part of my meaning of life. I always put myself in risky situations because of that which obviously because I used to be so naive.</p><figure name="f2b4" id="f2b4" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*NwXA-tq76L2dTTPkxHdTFw.jpeg" data-width="3264" data-height="2448" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*NwXA-tq76L2dTTPkxHdTFw.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="85bf" id="85bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Kindness is something to share with people around you but also is what can make others control you and transform you into what they want, using you to fulfill their goals or to make them stop feeling loneliness or weirdness. At the same time, we as weirdo people based on our thoughts (because of loneliness) are trying to be closer to any people that make us in a gig driving by togetherness. If we put all these data inside a matrix, we can find out that people don’t like nice people with ethics because they are showing a pure personality that looks so weak and easy to broke. That’s why they feel satisfied making lough of simplicity and discipline to things like rules, morals, and religions. I have these hypotheses all the time in my head but I couldn’t prove it as a fact in real life. Instead of avoiding to hanging out with those kinds of people like always because I know they will make me sense disgusting and I know to feel used by someone else looking for the sweet friendship emotions all the time and there is no one to share with, but this time I did put myself in purpose in the position of being the smarty-pants just to analyze closer the behavior of this kind of personalities. First I thought that this time something changed since we’re in a different environment different from my hometown so maybe people here aren’t the same but after going out with them a couple of time I started noticing something in the air.</p><figure name="d262" id="d262" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_Mvtln0VuEK2HGINed5Xxg.jpeg" data-width="1440" data-height="1440" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*_Mvtln0VuEK2HGINed5Xxg.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="a427" id="a427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Every time we’re talking about our beliefs, one of them does some kind of weird reaction that’s showing the inability of accepting my different ideas. One day, they decided to go party in a bar, and they invited me. As all of them know, bars are not my cup of tea because I have alcohol. I was going to say no but after that, something inside me said: “Okay I’m coming”. It wasn’t because I wanna party but I had a curiosity about how these people are looking at me and if they are respecting my identity, thoughts, and personality. So I went with them to discover this mysterious source of happiness. When we first met, one of them said to me some words from the “Quran” about being cursed if you join drunk people. I accepted as a joke and I knew that I’m doing something wrong but I also knew my noble goals. We arrived at the place and it wasn’t really that great for me. I start analyzing every single movement of my comrades doing it to observe whether my thoughts are correct or not. Everything was normal until one of them said: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“ I’m having fun seeing you pretending to be the good guy respecting his religion and going to the mosque for prayer and now you’re here with us”</strong>. That’s exactly what I was afraid of, being judged because of my beliefs and my choices in my personal life. After that, she said, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“ next time I’m sure you’ll put your ethical rules behind and drink some alcohols with us”</strong>. Everything was clear to me, someone is trying again to manipulate my choices because he/she hasn’t enough power to respect me. The results were clear from the beginning but I just was waiting for them to show me their faces.</p><figure name="b634" id="b634" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 394px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1QiJnmcaJjZYqkIkEkerbQ.jpeg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1QiJnmcaJjZYqkIkEkerbQ.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="0c0b" id="0c0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">I consider any decision taking by a person his responsibility and I have no right to judge him as a friend, parents or partner. Even the closest persons don’t have the right to judge you, maybe giving pieces of advice but not forcing you and making fun of you. We’re talking all the time about freedom and democracy but at the same time, we’re judging people based on their race, colors, religions, and opinions. The human being is the most disgusting creature in this world, you know why? Because we don’t know how to respect other creatures, we’re killing animals just for fun. We’re destroying forests just to have fancy houses and routes. We’re pretending to have this earth which not true at all because it’s not something we own. I want to stop this farce happening, I started by myself by respecting everyone around me and now it’s your turn. I’m waiting for you to be a better version of yourself!</p></div></div></section>
